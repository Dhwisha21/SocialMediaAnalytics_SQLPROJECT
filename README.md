# SocialMediaAnalytics_SQLPROJECT
Social Media Analytics Project
Overview

This project involves analyzing social media data to provide insights into user behavior, engagement, and trends. The SQL scripts provided are designed to process, aggregate, and analyze data stored in a relational database. These scripts are integral for extracting meaningful analytics that can inform decision-making strategies in marketing, content creation, and user interaction.

Sample Queries

-The SQL scripts include several example queries, such as:
-User engagement statistics (likes, comments, shares).
-Content performance analysis by type (video, image, text).
-User demographics and regional breakdowns.
-Time-based trend analysis (e.g., best times to post).

Project Setup
Prerequisites

A relational database management system (RDBMS) like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
A database tool (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, or any command-line interface) to execute the SQL queries.

Installation Steps

1. Set up the database
Ensure you have a running RDBMS and create a new database for this project.

2. Execute the SQL scripts
Run socialmedia_schema.sql to set up the database schema and populate it with sample data.
Run socialmedia_queries.sql to perform advanced analytics and generate insights.

3. Verify Data
After running the scripts, verify that the necessary tables have been created and populated with data by querying the database.
